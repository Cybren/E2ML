    "\n",
    "   No, it is just the probability to observe a test statistic value that is larger/smaller (depending on the side of the test) than $\\tilde{s}_N$ if the null hypothesis $H_0$ were true. So we make the assumption that $H_0$ is true beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "   (b) Are hypothesis tests carried out to decide if the null hypothesis is true or false?\n",
    "\n",
    "   No, we want to know if the h1 hypothesis is true.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   (c) Are hypothesis tests carried out to establish the test statistic?\n",
    "   \n",
    "   No, the test-statistic is chosen beforehand as part of the hypothesis test. It is a tool to perform the hypothesis test. We also make assumptions about the test-statistic without knowing the real distribution. Thus these assuption have to be accurate for our data to ensure the hypothesis test gives meaningfull results.\n",
